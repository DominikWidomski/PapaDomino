Domino's Pizza Bot Voice Box

At the moment simply a Chrome extension.

## Planned Improvements

* Voice settings options, change how the bot sounds.
* Testing, this implementation assumes the structure of the page, so it needs to be tested to know when it breaks.

## Contributing

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/DominikWidomski/PapaDomino/issues/new) on GitHub, be it for improvements or bugs.
This would also probably be a good place to put in an alert if the extension didn't work for you because the page structure has changed. Thanks!
