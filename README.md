Domino's Pizza Bot Voice Box

At the moment simply a simple Chrome extension.

It's delicious!

## Inspiration

As you have the pizza tracker open, you'd like to be able to get on with something else on your machine.
This extension gives Domino's pizza tracker a voice, so you can hear it when you're not on the page, as it updates you about the status of your order.

## Installation

1. Download ZIP and extract the contents somewhere or clone the repo,
2. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click **+ Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked extensionâ€¦**
5. Navigate to project's root folder and click OK

At this point you can delete the project folder if you wish, the extension was copied in.
However, if you wish to play around with it you can make changes to the code and reload the `chrome://extensions/` page.
This will reload the extension.

## Improvements

* Better text changes recognition.
* Voice settings options, change how the bot sounds.
* Testing, this implementation assumes the structure of the page, so it needs to be tested to know when it breaks.

## Contributing and Issues

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/DominikWidomski/PapaDomino/issues/new) on GitHub, be it for improvements or bugs.
This would also probably be a good place to put in an alert if the extension didn't work for you because the Domino's pizza tracker page structure has changed. **Thanks!**
